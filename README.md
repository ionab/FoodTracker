# Hibernate Food Tracker Lab

You have been asked model a daily food tracker. Think about the relationships between classes and persist them via Hibernate. You will need to use inheritance (only where it is logical to do so).

## MVP
 - Record meals eaten on a daily basis
 - Create CRUD functions using a DBHelper

## Possible Extensions
 - calculate calorie intake from daily meals
 - view all food eaten on a certain date


### REMEMBER
TDD your models (do not try to test your database)
